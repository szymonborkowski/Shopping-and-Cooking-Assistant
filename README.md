# Shopping and Cooking Assistant - SACA
## Features:
#### Home Screen:
(Progress: not yet implemented)
The user will be greeted with the home interface when they open the app. This is where they will be recommended new recipes based on, initially, a shared global rating system, but as the app advances, an algorithm which looks at the recipes the user liked previously and recommends similar recipes based on that.

#### Recipe Search Screen:
(Progress: basic implementation integrated)
The search interface is where the user can manually enter recipe names and search in the online database of available recipes. They can also apply different filters to their search. This lets them sort their search query into categories such as allergies, types of cuisine, and total price of meal.

#### Calendar Screen:
(Progress: basic implementation integrated)
The calendar interface is a place where the user can select one or more days and plan certain meals for those days by selecting different recipes, this will then generate a shopping list for the user. This shopping list will take into account how many days the user plans to cook each recipe for and adjust the amount of ingredients they need.

#### Virtual Basket Screen:
(Progress: basic implementation integrated)
When the user enters a shop they will use the shopping interface. This interface will include a barcode scanner in the form of the userâ€™s camera that is on their device. This allows the user to scan items and add them to their virtual basket. Once the user is done with their shopping they will potentially be allowed to pay through the app and leave the store.

#### User Profile Screen:
(Progress: basic implementation integrated)
To add, remove, or modify information about themselves the user will use the user profile interface. This will be filled with editable text boxes that the user can modify and submit. Once the user saves the changes they will be uploaded to the database. The user will also be able to access their inventory from this interface, this includes the ingredients they already have at home. This feature will come in handy when someone is out doing shopping but they forget what they already have at home.
