The calendar interface is a place where the user can select one or more days and plan certain meals for those days by selecting different recipes, this will then generate a shopping list for the user. This shopping list will take into account how many days the user plans to cook each recipe for and adjust the amount of ingredients they need.  
  
## Virtual Basket Screen:  
When the user enters a shop they will use the shopping interface. This interface will include a barcode scanner in the form of the userâ€™s camera that is on their device. This allows the user to scan items and add them to their virtual basket. Once the user is done with their shopping they add the ingredients they bought into their inventory.
